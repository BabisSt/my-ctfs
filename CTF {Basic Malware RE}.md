#CTF 

These challenges are aimed towards learning about the "Static Analysis" technique used to analyze the malware. The main aim for this room is not to used any types of debuggers neither the executable's/programs should be run on any platform. You are required to answer all the questions without even using the debugger and even not executing the executable's/programs.

Meanwhile all the credits goes to **@MalwareTechBlog** for creating these awesome challenges.

## Strings :: Challenge 1
This executable prints an MD5 Hash on the screen when executed. Can you grab the exact flag?

So I downloaded IDA and used `chmod +x ida_file` then `./ida_file` to install it.

Then I opened IDA and loaded the first file. 
In the Function Name I navigated to start and found the flag.
`mov     eax, off_432294 ; "FLAG{CAN-I-MAKE-IT-ANYMORE-OBVIOUS}"`

## Strings :: Challenge 2
This executable prints an MD5 Hash on the screen when executed. Can you grab the exact flag?

Again open IDA, went to start function and there was the flag with one letter at a time like :
```

mov     [ebp+var_28], 46h ; 'F'
mov     [ebp+var_27], 4Ch ; 'L'
...
```


## Strings 3 :: Challenge 3
This executable prints an MD5 Hash on the screen when executed. Can you grab the exact flag?

Run Ghidra, found flag.
